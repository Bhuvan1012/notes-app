# Notes-App
## Key skills: NodeJs, NPM, Command line arguments
In this application we are using node's global **file system** module to which we are passing arguments from the command-line with the 
help of **yargs** NPM package to perform various actions like:
- Adding a note
- Removing a note
- Listing all the notes 
- Reading a particular note
